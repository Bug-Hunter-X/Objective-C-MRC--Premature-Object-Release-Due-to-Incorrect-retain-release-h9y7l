In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from misusing the `retain` and `release` methods in manual reference counting (MRC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    NSString *tempString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    self.myString = tempString; //This retains tempString.
    [tempString release]; //This is incorrect. The retain count is now 1.
}
@end
```

The issue is that `self.myString = tempString;` implicitly retains `tempString`.  Subsequently releasing `tempString` directly leads to a premature release, causing crashes later when the object is accessed.  The correct approach is to avoid explicitly releasing `tempString`, letting the assignment handle the memory management.
